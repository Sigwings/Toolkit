I decided to add version control with an online backup to some of my personal collection of programming tools.

Brief list of tools:
AutoReport - Handles errors, automation vs manual, emailing, report titles, email subject lines, etc.
Booking - Automates "Booking In" process in Firefox (customer-specific).
DateTools - Simplifies Date handling.
Despatch - Automates "Despatch" process in Firefox (customer-specific).
ExamplePasswords - Example of the file used to store personal data, such as passwords, away from the core code.
Holidays - Simplifies calculations involving Bank Holidays.
ISS Builder - Script which creates Inno Setup + Ocra exe installer build commands and config files.
MechReporter - Automates reporting using Mechanize (customer-specific).
RDT - Base class for task automation in Firefox (customer-specific).
RegistryTools - Simplifies Registry tasks.
WinBoxes - Provides Windows inputbox, msgbox, and popup for user interaction without a full-fledged GUI.
